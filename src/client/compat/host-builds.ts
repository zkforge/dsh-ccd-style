/**
 * CSS-module prefix tables for the shipped DSH builds.
 *
 * DSH hashes CSS-module class names per build, and the installers are separate
 * builds even at one version: `0.2.0-rc.2` ships commit `5e9e301d` for macOS and
 * `04f392c9` for Windows, and every class of the pinned UI packages hashes
 * differently between them. This plugin's stylesheets and `HOST` selectors are
 * authored against the macOS build; a build listed below is rewritten through
 * {@link aliasHostClasses} before it reaches the document, so one source styles
 * both installers instead of duplicating every selector.
 *
 * Only the prefix differs. The local name after it (`_frame`, `_newSession`)
 * and the static web frontend's markdown classes (`_markdown_1ypvv_5`) are
 * identical in both builds, so neither needs an entry here.
 *
 * The tables are pinned to the DSH version the plugin declares
 * (`dsh.engines.dsh = "=0.2.0-rc.2"`): a later release may rehash every prefix
 * again, and both tables then have to be refreshed from that build's
 * `app.asar` — the same single-place update `host-dom.ts` documents.
